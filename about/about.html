							<h2><i>Brief History</i></h2>
							<p>"To make it big in the culinary world through precise and excellent skill." 
							This was an aspiration shared by two men, who, driven with much passion, 
							pursued their culinary dreams overseas in the year 2012. While abroad,
							they were both hired as cooks under the careful supervision of one of the most 
							respected master chef in Japan, Hagemu Nishimura. Equally as dedicated
							as the young men he called his students, Hagemu Nimishura skillfully 
							enhanced and bestowed every ounce of his culinary knowledge upon his 
							cooks producing the outstanding chefs they are now. However, after more 
							than six years of detailed hands-on training, Chef Hagemu made the 
							decision of hanging up his apron and took a break.
							<br><br>								
							The two brothers, more experienced than ever, then came up with the idea of 
							putting a restaurant that would serve nothing but authentic Japanese dishes 
							imparted to them by their master. This idea of theirs turned into sweet reality, 
							although they had one more thing left to deal with. They weren't so certain 
							what to call their newly built home. After some time of thinking for the perfect 
							name, they finally came up with the decision to name the restaurant after the 
							great master chef himself; not only to pay him respect but also as a constant 
							reminder of their remarkable and one-of-a-kind friendship.</p>
